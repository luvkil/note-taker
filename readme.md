# Note- Taker
This is an app that can be used to write, save and delete notes. Its intention is for busy people on the go who needs to store and update personal and business  information as quickly and as efficeintly as possible. This is my first attempt at using express to write backend code. It will retrieve note data from a JSON file.

When you get to the notes page, on the left, you see saved notes along with a delete icon to trash the note when you're done.
On the right, you can create a new note with a title and notes within the description.
On the top right-hand corner, you can click save to automatically save the new note to the list on the left.
